        <h1 id= "something">The Park</h1>
        <p>The park by which I live in Park Slope Brooklyn is commonly known as JJ Byrne Park. My friends and I often hang out there and it has become so iconic to us that we simply refer to it as "the park". If you were to walk to the park, you would see a construction site that has been there for what feels like ages. If you were to take my route to the park, you would see a handful of kids from the ages of 16 to 24 using drugs or drinking alcohol. They think they are hidden by the cryptic side entrance behind the large tree, though it is glaringly obvious that they can easily be seen by passersby. You then finally enter the park through a hole in the fence which makes the entrance slightly humorous and unique from other parks.</p>
        <p id= "blah">Upon entering, you can identify 4 distinct sections. There is a playground where little kids play together and where I used to play baseball with my brother and my dad when I was young. At the playground, there are a lot of options for kids: monkey bars, swings, and sprinklers. There is also a turf field where one could play football and soccer. When I was in elementary school, I would usually play soccer after the school day ended. In addition, there are handball courts at which my friends and I made up a game we called "off the wall." Finally, there are basketball courts where I have been playing basketball for most of my life.</p>
